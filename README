Clean Build
--------------------

Clean build is a tool for building ports in a clean chroot environment. Union
filesystems are used so the base system can be used simultaneously in multiple
environments. Changes are only made to the overlay filesystem, keeping your core
system in pristine condition.

As of writing, the unionfs is not part of the linux kernel. You will need to
apply patches to your kernel source tree.

Actions
--------------------

There are a number of actions that can be used to automate some of the processes
required when setting up build environment.

initcore - this creates the basic structure of your core, creating the directory
	   and the package database file.

installcore - installs core ports into your environment

addports - allows you to add ports to the core system

binddirs - binds directories to your core or overlay system.


Tuneables
--------------------

Clean build has a number of options you can set either by the command line or
in a configuration file
